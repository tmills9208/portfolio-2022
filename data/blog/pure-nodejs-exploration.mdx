# Pure Node.js Exploration

![Nodejs-Screenshot](/static/images/blog/node-js1.png)

As I began preparing to enter the work force, I began to look into more techs that most employers are looking into. I know express.js is widely used, but the purpose of this part 1 project is to use node.js as bare as possible, meaning no major frameworks (even though express.js is minimal, will explore on part 2). Using mysql and common-js modules as much as possible (however, Typescript kind of blurs the line here with preferring to use ES6 imports).

So far, the project uses / implements:

- Independent controllers and services that are injected into eachother.
- Generic iDbController and iServices interfaces to generate mocks for testing later.
- Usage of basic http and node.js functions and packages, using Typescript to keep the code better organized and clean.
- Usage of Jest for Unit/Integration testing (working on it)
- Basic SQL CRUD Functions for each service/controller, utilizing common industry standards.
- Git submodules for usage across all other projects with the developed and constructed iControllers and iServices.
